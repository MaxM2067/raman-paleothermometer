# Raman Spectroscopy Paleothermometer Web App

## Purpose

This web-based application is designed to analyze Raman spectroscopy data from ceramic samples. It serves as a paleothermometer ‚Äî allowing users to both build calibration curves from experimental firing data and estimate firing temperatures of archaeological samples.

## Features

### üî¨ Dual Tab Interface
- **Experimental Data Tab**
  - Upload multiple spectrum files with known firing temperatures
  - Navigate through files using dropdown or quick navigation buttons (<<, >>)
  - Detect D and G peaks using two methods: Simple (moving average) and Voigt + Savitzky-Golay
  - Calculate key parameters: HD/HG, D Width, G Width, WD/WG
  - Plot calibration curves with individual data, averages, standard deviations, and trendlines
  - Compare Simple vs Voigt results with statistical significance testing
  - Selectively include/exclude samples using checkboxes
  - Toggle visibility of smoothing and fitting curves

- **Archaeological Samples Tab**
  - Upload multiple spectra of samples with unknown firing temperature
  - Navigate through samples using dropdown or quick navigation buttons (<<, >>)
  - Apply the same analysis pipeline (method, intervals, height %) as the Experimental Tab for consistency
  - Click "Derive Temperatures" button to (re)calculate and display derived temperatures and update calibration plots.
  - Derive temperature ranges based on calibration curves from experimental data. The derived temperature table shows:
    - "Best estimate" temperatures (where the archaeological sample's value crosses the mean calibration curve).
    - "Possible range" temperatures (where the archaeological sample's value falls within the mean ¬± standard deviation of the calibration curve).
    - For values outside the mean calibration curve but within the SD band, the "best estimate" shows the midpoint of the in-SD range.
    - If a value is entirely out of the calibration curve (even with SD), it's reported as "Out of range (closest: X¬∞C)", indicating the temperature at the nearest edge of the calibration curve.
  - Show spectra and fitted peaks for each sample (if applicable based on selected method).
  - Display derived temperatures in a summary table for each parameter (HD/HG, D Width, G Width, WD/WG), including best estimates and SD ranges.
  - Overlay archaeological points on calibration charts:
    - Points are plotted at their derived temperature(s) against their parameter value.
    - Out-of-range archaeological points are visually distinguished (e.g., hollow circles with dashed borders).
    - Tooltips for out-of-range points display "Out of range (closest: X¬∞C)".
    - Calibration chart Y-axis automatically adjusts with padding to ensure out-of-range points are visible.

### üìà Plotting & Interactivity
- Full spectrum plot with:
  - Detected peak centers
  - Width lines at user-defined % height
  - Voigt fitted curves when applicable
  - Savitzky-Golay smoothing overlay
- Independent charts for each tab
- Chart.js based visualizations with hover tooltips and interactive legends
- Method-specific data visualization (Simple/Voigt) in statistical plots
- Error bars showing standard deviations
- Peak labels with wavelength values
- Width labels showing FWHM values
- Calibration charts in the Archaeological tab dynamically update with overlaid archaeological sample points.
  - Visual distinction for out-of-range points and informative tooltips.
  - Y-axis scales adjust to include all data points, including standard deviations and out-of-range archaeological samples.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Controls
- User-selectable peak intervals and search width height (% of peak)
- Drop-down to select method (Simple or Voigt)
- Mode selection (Broad/Conventional) with synchronized controls across tabs
- Quick file navigation with previous/next buttons
- Sample inclusion/exclusion controls for statistical analysis
- Button to re-analyze spectra
- Visual tab switching with active-state styling
- Toggle switches for smoothing and fitting visualization

### üìä Statistics and Data Analysis
- Grouped results by firing temperature
- Average, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error calculations
- Overlay of means and error bars on scatter plots
- Method comparison table with paired t-test and significance flags
- Interactive data selection through checkboxes
- Separate statistical plots for:
  - HD/HG Ratio

  - G Width
  - WD/WG Ratio
- Method comparison charts showing both Simple and Voigt results
- Detailed statistical tables with temperature-wise breakdowns

### üîÑ Synchronization Features
- Synchronized method selection between tabs (Experimental tab controls Archaeological tab calculations).
- Synchronized mode selection (Broad/Conventional) (Experimental tab controls Archaeological tab calculations).
- Peak interval and width percentage settings from the Experimental tab are used for all calculations in the Archaeological tab to ensure consistency.
- Automatic parameter updates when changing methods.
- Default value restoration for different modes
- Consistent width percentage settings across tabs

### üßÆ Data Processing

- Peak detection with multiple algorithms
- Width calculation at user-defined heights
- Automatic valley detection between peaks
- Temperature extraction from filenames
- Pseudo-Voigt function fitting for peak analysis
- Matrix operations for Savitzky-Golay coefficients
- Linear interpolation for precise width measurements
