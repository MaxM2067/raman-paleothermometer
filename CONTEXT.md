# Raman Spectroscopy Paleothermometer Web App

## Purpose

This web-based application is designed to analyze Raman spectroscopy data from ceramic samples. It serves as a paleothermometer ‚Äî allowing users to both build calibration curves from experimental firing data and estimate firing temperatures of archaeological samples.

## Features

### üî¨ Dual Tab Interface
- **Experimental Data Tab**
  - Upload multiple spectrum files with known firing temperatures
  - Navigate through files using dropdown or quick navigation buttons (<<, >>)
  - Detect D and G peaks using two methods: Simple (moving average) and Voigt + Savitzky-Golay
  - Calculate key parameters: HD/HG, D Width, G Width, WD/WG
  - Plot calibration curves with individual data, averages, standard deviations, and trendlines
  - Compare Simple vs Voigt results with statistical significance testing
  - Selectively include/exclude samples using checkboxes
  - Toggle visibility of smoothing and fitting curves

- **Archaeological Samples Tab**
  - Upload multiple spectra of samples with unknown firing temperature
  - Navigate through samples using dropdown or quick navigation buttons (<<, >>)
  - Apply the same analysis pipeline (method, intervals, height %)
  - Derive temperature ranges based on calibration curves from experimental data
  - Show spectra and fitted peaks for each sample
  - Display derived temperatures in a summary table
  - Overlay archaeological points on calibration charts 

### üìà Plotting & Interactivity
- Full spectrum plot with:
  - Detected peak centers
  - Width lines at user-defined % height
  - Voigt fitted curves when applicable
  - Savitzky-Golay smoothing overlay
- Independent charts for each tab
- Chart.js based visualizations with hover tooltips and interactive legends
- Method-specific data visualization (Simple/Voigt) in statistical plots
- Error bars showing standard deviations
- Peak labels with wavelength values
- Width labels showing FWHM values

### ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Controls
- User-selectable peak intervals and search width height (% of peak)
- Drop-down to select method (Simple or Voigt)
- Mode selection (Broad/Conventional) with synchronized controls across tabs
- Quick file navigation with previous/next buttons
- Sample inclusion/exclusion controls for statistical analysis
- Button to re-analyze spectra
- Visual tab switching with active-state styling
- Toggle switches for smoothing and fitting visualization

### üìä Statistics and Data Analysis
- Grouped results by firing temperature
- Average, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error calculations
- Overlay of means and error bars on scatter plots
- Method comparison table with paired t-test and significance flags
- Interactive data selection through checkboxes
- Separate statistical plots for:
  - HD/HG Ratio
  - D Width
  - G Width
  - WD/WG Ratio
- Method comparison charts showing both Simple and Voigt results
- Detailed statistical tables with temperature-wise breakdowns

### üîÑ Synchronization Features
- Synchronized method selection between tabs
- Synchronized mode selection (Broad/Conventional)
- Automatic parameter updates when changing methods
- Default value restoration for different modes
- Consistent width percentage settings across tabs

### üßÆ Data Processing
- Savitzky-Golay smoothing for Voigt method
- Peak detection with multiple algorithms
- Width calculation at user-defined heights
- Automatic valley detection between peaks
- Temperature extraction from filenames
- Pseudo-Voigt function fitting for peak analysis
- Matrix operations for Savitzky-Golay coefficients
- Linear interpolation for precise width measurements

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 + CSS3 (custom styling)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Chart.js with error bars plugin
- Chart.js Annotation plugin
- FileReader API (for .txt file loading)
- Client-side peak detection, fitting, and statistical analysis

## Project Structure

- `index.html` ‚Äî dual-tab UI layout with synchronized controls
- `script.js` ‚Äî full analysis pipeline, data processing, and visualization logic
- `styles.css` ‚Äî UI and tab design

## Intended Usage

1. Upload experimental data in the first tab to build calibration models
2. Use checkboxes to include/exclude specific samples from analysis
3. Switch between Simple and Voigt methods to compare results
4. Navigate through files using dropdown or navigation buttons
5. Toggle smoothing and fitting visualization as needed
6. Switch to the archaeological tab to upload unknowns
7. Use plots and tables to interpret thermal history
8. Export or analyze results using the statistical tools provided

## Notes
