First read the codebase to refresh your memory of the project, especially scripts.js file. 

Don't change or delete other functions, consider minimal changes to the code. Ask user questions if needed. 

Emplement the current feature ensuring the rest of the methods and functions work the same and not interrupted, don't change their logic. Don't make any other refactoring of other functions.
